2.20
We designed the basic struture of this project, and decided which part should be done first.
We create response class and request_info class to parse request from client and response from original server

2.22
We started to design more details about our proxy class. Proxy class burdens the most significant tasks in this 
project. We plan to handle three methods in this class.

2.25
We finished some socket operation like create connect and receive and writed some test for request_info and response. We find that there are many 
other request and response header need to be parsed. We update them and add several flags. 

2.28
We finished handling connect and begin to study how cache work and design struture of cache. We also finished Makefile.

3.1 
We finished handling post method and update receive manner when socket receive request and response.We also 
finished cache but haven't test it.

3.2 
We implemented handleGet() method using cache and also added logfile part in code.

3.3 
We found that there were some issues in time conversion. We did more study and fixed these issues.

3.4
We added multi-thread and completed logFile writing. We tried to test our post and connect and found some bugs. Therefore, we
rewrote more unit tests to clarify where the issue came from. We found string size is wrong when we try to convert 
vector char to string. We fixed this issue.

3.6
We tested get method as well as cache. Through communication with TA, we found that there are some issues in 
cache policy. We didn't check request's cache control. And the order of justify time validation also has a little
issue. We fixed them.

3.7
We wrote more unit tests and tested more get connect and post case. We tested time checking and revalidtion mechanism'server
correctness. And fixed several bugs.

3.9
We finished docker configuration and ran it in docker. We also finished deamon modification and then submitted it.


Exception :
1. We have close the socket_fd after finishing the corresponding work. 
2. We have delete all of the space allocated by new. 
3. All of our class use std class to construct and there is no pointer in them.
